Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions and to control the creation of new units. They are decentralized, meaning they operate independently of a central authority such as a bank or government.

The first and most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and use cases.

Cryptocurrencies are typically stored in digital wallets and can be used to buy goods and services, transfer funds, and make investments. They are often used as a means of payment or investment due to their potential for fast and secure transactions, low fees, and independence from traditional financial institutions.

The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by supply and demand in the market, and their prices can be highly volatile. Some critics have raised concerns about the potential use of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities such as money laundering or terrorism financing, as well as their potential impact on financial stability and consumer protection.
